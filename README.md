Project Overview:

This project aims to predict house prices using different linear regression techniques. The goal is to identify which factors most influence housing prices and to select the best-performing model among Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso Regression.


Models Used:

Simple Linear Regression

Multiple Linear Regression

Ridge Regression

Lasso Regression



Tech Stack:

Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data preprocessing

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization

Scikit-learn – Modeling and evaluation



Finding: 

Best Model: Multiple Linear Regression (highest R² and lowest RMSE)
